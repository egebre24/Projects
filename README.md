# Projects Python code
## Final Project - Part 1 & 2

- **FinalProjectP1.ipynb**: Contains the initial exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization steps.
- **FinalProjectP2.ipynb**: Contains the continuation of the project with clustering, modeling, and conclusions.

These notebooks are part of my final data science project, which demonstrates an end-to-end analysis.
