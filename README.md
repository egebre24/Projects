# Projects Python code
## Final Project - Part 1 & 2

- **FinalProjectP1.ipynb**: Contains the initial exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization steps.
- **FinalProjectP2.ipynb**: Contains the continuation of the project with clustering, modeling, and conclusions.

These notebooks are part of my final data science project, which demonstrates an end-to-end analysis.
This project is centered on Crime Data Prediction  
The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) is the police department of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, United States.
which includes the City of Charlotte.
08/2023 – 12/2023 
● Analyzed crime data (2011–2016) using Python, focusing on weapon usage patterns and seasonal trends with 
GeoPandas and ArcGIS for geospatial insights.  
● Applied advanced statistical techniques and machine learning models, including Logistic regression, Naive 
Bayes, Decision tree, Random Forest, K-Means Clustering, and DBSCAN to uncover crime patterns and enhance 
predictive accuracy. 
● Developed predictive models to optimize resource allocation for law enforcement. Testing and training these 
models by creating a balanced test for the unbalanced models using SMOT. 


## Capstone Project
01/2025 - 05/2025
A project that conducts a study on immigration integration &urban development in the US to inform policy on 
economic inclusion and resilience.  
● Using U.S. census data, a time-series analysis was created, along with predictive models such as linear 
regressions, K-means, and XGBoost
